{
	Novelty search is a technique used in evolutionary robotics to prevent search
	algorithms from prematurely converging on local optima.
	In this thesis, I propose two combinations of novelty with fitness and
	compare their performance on a maze navigation task using a genetic algorithm.
	Neither of the proposed combinations were significantly better than novelty search on
	solving the task.
