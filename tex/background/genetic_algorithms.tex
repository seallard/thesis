\subsection{Genetic algorithms}
\todo{Describe what type of problems that have been solved successfully with GA:s.}
Genetic algorithms are optimisation algorithms based on evolution. The fundamental idea is that
of repeated selection of solutions which are better according to some metric from a population (see Algorithm \ref{algorithm}).
Variation is introduced in the population by applying mutation- and crossover operators to the
selected solutions. The mutation operators slightly change the solutions whereas the crossover
operator is used to form offspring solutions from the selected solutions.

Each solution is encoded by a genotype, also referred to as a genome. The genome contains
genes which specify the solution. The crossover and mutation operators are applied to those genes.
During the evaluation, the genotype is translated to its corresponding phenotype -
the actual solution which can be evaluated. See \cite{compint} for more details.
