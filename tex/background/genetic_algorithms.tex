Genetic algorithms (GAs) are search algorithms based on evolution. The implementation of GAs vary, but
generally follow the pattern outlined in Algorithm 1 below. Starting from a random population of individuals
representing solutions to the problem . Each individual represents a solution to the problem being
studied. A fitness function scores how well each individual solves the problem. Variation is introduced
in the population by letting individuals reproduce with each other, usually in proportion to their fitness
scores. Offspring is created by applying by a crossover operator which combine parts of the parent solutions,
much like the crossover between chromosomes during sexual reproduction in nature. A second source of variation
is applied in the form of mutations, each gene is randomly altered with some probability.
