\subsection{Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies}
Neuroevolution uses evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, to optimise ANNs \cite{neuroevolution_review}.
One such algorithm is Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which evolves the topology and weights of ANNs \cite{neat_main}.
It gained traction when published since it adressed some previous problems in neuroevolution and illustrated that the learning speed could
be increased by evolving the structure of the networks.

NEAT uses a direct encoding; genomes contain link and node genes which specify the network. Each link gene references
the two node genes it span (see Figure).

The innovation number attribute of the connection gene is used during crossover to align genes of the same origin.
