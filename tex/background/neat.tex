\subsection{Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies}

Neuroevolution combines genetic algorithms with neural networks to evolve parameters of networks. The idea of 
neuroevolution arose in the XXs as an extension of previous research on...
One subset of neuroevolution algorithms are Topology and Weight Evolving Neural Networks (TWEANNs). These
evolve both the topology and weights.

One TWEANN called Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) has been especially successful [...].
NEAT addressed three previously unsolved problems within neuroevolution, which are outlined in the subsections below.
