Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are function approximators loosely inspired by nervous systems.
ANNs consist of nodes connected by directed links (see Figure \ref{feedforward}). Each node receives signals, either as input from
the environment or other nodes. Each link is associated with a weight which inhibits or excites the signal passing
over it. The nodes sum the incoming weighted signals, calculating a net input signal. A function
is applied to the net input signal to generate an output signal. The function is referred to as an activation function
and regulates the strength of the output signal given the net input signal. The signal is propagated through the network
until it reaches the final output node or nodes.

Different algorithms exist to update parameters of the network, such as the weights of the
links, as to improve the final output. The process in which the parameters of the network is updated
is referred to as training. For example, supervised learning algorithms for ANNs use input-output examples
to train the network. The input example is fed into the network and the output of the network is compared to
the expected output of the example. The difference is used to update the weights in the network as to decrease
the error for the current example.


\todo{Provide more detailed}
These activation functions mimics the behaviour of biological neurons, where the neuron propagates
a signal only if the incoming signals exceed some threshold.

\todo{Describe bias neurons}

\todo{Describe different topologies}
Links that go backwards towards the inputs, so called recurrent links, gives the network short-term memory.
