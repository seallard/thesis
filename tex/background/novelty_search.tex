\subsection{Novelty search}
Novelty search can be used with any evolutionary algorithm by replacing the objective
function with a novelty metric. A novelty metric characterises how distant a solution
is in the behaviour space compared to an archive of discovered solutions. It is a measure
of sparseness $\rho$ and can be computed at a point $x$ as the average distance of the
$k$-nearest neighbours
\[
    \rho(x) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k} dist(x, n_{i})
\]

where $n_{i}$ is the $i$th-nearest neighbour of $x$ using some distant metric $dist$.
