\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Neither of the proposed combinations of fitness and novelty search were significantly better
than LS-50 on any of the mazes. The robustness of the proposed combinations was not studied, so
it might be the case that the combinations perform better with other values. It might also be the
case that it is more appropriate to adjust $\rho$ based on another measure of the progress of
the search.
