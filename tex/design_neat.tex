\section{Implementation of NEAT}

I implemented NEAT in Python based on the original C++ version. To verify the functionality of my implementation and compare it to
the original one \cite{neat_main}, the performance on XOR was tested. Data was collected from 100 runs (see Table \ref{xor_verification}).
Each run was terminated once a network that solved XOR was found or the number of network evaluations exceeded 20 000.

    \caption{The performance on XOR of my and the original implementation of NEAT. A population size of 150 networks was used.
             The statistics were calculated over 100 runs.}
    \label{xor_verification}
\end{table}
The difference in the mean number of evaluations was not significant at the $0.05$ level ($p=0.11$).
The networks found by my implementation seem to be larger on average.
The latter might be due to the higher mutation rates I had to use for the addition of nodes and links
to obtain satisfactory results.
