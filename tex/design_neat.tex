\section{Implementation of NEAT}

I implemented NEAT in Python based on the original C++ version. To verify the functionality of my implementation and compare it to
the original one \cite{neat_main}, the performance on XOR was tested. Data was collected from 100 runs (see Table \ref{xor_verification}).
Each run was terminated once a network was found that solved XOR or the number of network evaluations exceeded 20 000.
The parameters used can be found in appendix \ref{parameter_values}.

\end{table}
The results are overall similar. While my implementation finds solutions in slightly fewer
evaluations, the networks are on average larger and fewer minimal structures are found.
