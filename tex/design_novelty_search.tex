\section{Implementation of novelty search}
The novelty search algorithm was implemented in Python based on the conclusions of \cite{ns_study}.
The parameter k, dictating the number of nearest neighbours considered when calculating the novelty score,
was set to 15. The archive is composed of randomly selected solutions. The growth rate of the archive was set
to 6 solutions per generation.
