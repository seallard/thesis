\section{Implementation of novelty search}
The novelty search algorithm was implemented in Python based on the conclusions of \cite{ns_study}.
The parameter k, the number of nearest neighbours considered when calculating the novelty score,
was set to 15. The archive was expanded each generation with $6$ randomly selected
solutions from the population.
