In this thesis I apply a neuroevolution algorithm to bipedal walking and compare its performance for two different fitness functions.

\subsection{Related work}
Several different techniques for combining novelty and fitness exists that perform better than novelty or
fitness based search alone on various tasks \cite{ns_study}. Novelty search ensures the behaviour space is explored
more uniformly whereas fitness exploits the discovered behaviours by gradually improving them.

For example, novelty can be combined with fitness using a weighted sum \cite{}.
Another combination, called Minimal  uses the fitness scores to cull the population
and
