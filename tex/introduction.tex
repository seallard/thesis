\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro}

Optimisation algorithms use objective functions to guide the search for optimal solutions.
But some problems and objective functions are deceptive, causing the algorithm to become stuck at
locally optimal solutions.

For example, consider the problem of optimising a controller for a bipedal
robot. Intuitively, one could base the objective function on the distance the robot is able to travel.
That would mean controllers which increase the distance the robot is able to travel are favoured.
However, this objective function might cause the algorithm to converge on unstable controllers which
propels the robot forwards without control. The solutions along the path to the optimal solution
do not necessarily resemble it. To be able to walk a long distance, it might be necessary to find
solutions for falling and crawling. The optimal solution is not always reachable by just
following the gradient of the objective function.

Many different techniques exists for avoiding and getting out of local optima. One such technique, called
novelty search, discards the notion of an objective. Instead, solutions are scored based on how novel
they are in comparison to previously found solutions.

In this thesis I investigate whether alternating between novelty and objective search provide any
benefits when solving deceptive mazes and a bipedal walking task. The simulated robots in the tasks are
controlled by neural networks which are optimised using an evolutionary algorithm.

\subsection{Related work}
Several combinations exists that perform better than novelty or objective based search alone
on various tasks \cite{ns_study}. For example, novelty
can be combined with fitness using a weighted sum. Other combinations disregard solutions
below some threshold objective value,


Novelty search ensures the behaviour space is explored more uniformly whereas fitness exploits the discovered behaviours
by gradually improving them. This idea forms the basis of quality diversity optimisation,
which generate repertoires of optimised diverse solutions.
