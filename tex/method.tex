\section{Method}
Most research on variations of novelty search has been done in the domain of maze solving. Mazes are useful
since they allow for the construction of tasks of varying deceptiveness. If the objective function is
based on the distance to the end of the maze, simply following its gradient might trap the agent in
dead-ends. The maze can be seen as an abstraction for difficult problems in which the fitness
landscape is deceptive.

\subsection{Maze navigation task}
In maze navigation, a simulated robot must navigate through a maze within a number of time steps.
The robot is controlled by a neural network which, given the readings from the robots sensors,
outputs two forces adjusting the robots linear and angular velocity.

The robots six rangefinder sensors measure the distance to walls. If a wall occurs within the sensors
direction and maximum range, the distance is returned.The four radar sensors return binary
values indicating whether the end-point is directly reachable within their field of view.

Two mazes are used to compare the novelty search variants (see Figure \ref{mazes}) similar to the ones in \cite{novelty_alone}.

\subsection{Fitness and novelty metric}
The fitness function is defined as $f = b - d$ where $b$ is a constant ensuring the fitness stays positive
and $d$ is the distance from the robots final position to the maze end-point after an evaluation.
The novelty metric is defined as the distance between the robots different end-positions in the maze.
These metrics have consistently been used in previous studies on novelty search.

\subsection{Proposed combinations}
I propose two combinations of novelty with fitness: novelty injection and novelty dynamic weighted sum (NDWS).

In novelty injection, novelty search is used only if stagnation is detected. That is, if no solution is found with a
higher fitness within some threshold number of generations, the fitness metric is swapped for novelty for a fixed
number of generations.

In NDWS, a weighted sum of novelty and fitness is used. The weights are updated during runtime - the novelty
weight is proportional to the number of generations since a solution of higher fitness was found.

\subsection{Experimental design}
The aim of both proposed combinations is to reduce the time spent exploring irrelevant parts of the solution space
compared to existing combinations of novelty and fitness.

Each variant is evaluated over $30$ runs, each run being terminated once a solution is found
or the number of evaluations exceeds $70 000$. The success ratio of each variant is recorded
(the percentage of runs which found a solution for the different mazes).
