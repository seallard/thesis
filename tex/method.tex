\section{Method}
Most research on variations of novelty search has been done in the domain of maze solving. Mazes are useful
since they allow for the construction of tasks of varying deceptiveness. If the objective function is
based on the distance to the end of the maze, simply following its gradient might trap the agent in
dead-ends. These mazes can be seen as abstractions for real problems in which the objective
landscape is deceptive.

\subsection{Maze navigation task}
In the maze navigation tasks, a simulated robot must navigate a maze from a starting point to an end-point.
The robot is controlled by a neural network which, given the readings from the rangefinder and radar
sensors, outputs two forces which adjust its linear and angular velocity. The 

Describe the maze agent, inputs, outputs, when the problem is solved, the different mazes.

\subsection{Novelty search variants studied}
Describe the different variants that will be compared.

\subsection{Experimental design}
Describe how the experiments will be run. What statistics will be collected and why.
