\subsection{Discussion}
All of the studied variants were able to solve the medium-difficult maze in most of the runs.
As expected, the novelty search variants solve the medium maze in fewer evaluations on average
compared to the pure fitness metric. However, LS-50 and injection were the only variants for which
the difference was significant at the $0.01$ level ($p=0.0012$ and $p=0.0068$). The mean number of
links and nodes in the solution networks for LS-50 and injection were also lower
compared to the pure fitness metric with significance at the $0.01$ level.
